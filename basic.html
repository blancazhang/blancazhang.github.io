	<h4>Ocean Acidification Magazine Spread Design</h4>

		<h5>Planning</h5>
		
		<img class="right" src="img/basic/sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch"/>
		
		<p>My first sketch of the magazine spread layout.  I initially wanted to have the image on the first page be a photograph of words written in water on paper, but this proved to be a near impossible task, since every type of paper I tried would absorb the water before I could finish writing out the sentence (even cardstock!).  I decided to create the image digitally, the process for which I will outline in a bit.</p>
		
		<p>I ultimately changed a few more of the original elements, the most noticable of which is the graphic in the first column of text in the article.  I originally planned to place a diagram of the chemical reaction that causes ocean acidification, but I later changed it to a graphic of levels of acidification worldwide.  The new image is in the shape of the earth, and its round outline offsets the vertical lines of text.</p>

		<h5>The Image</h5>
		
			<p>
				<img class="left" src="img/basic/poster.png" alt="The Image"/>

				This original image was created in Adobe Photoshop using a drop shadow, bevel &amp; emboss, and a custom gloss contour that I created.

			<p>I'm passionate about environmental conservation and sustainability, and I knew that a magazine spread had the potential for a great call to action to inform people about the issue of ocean acidifcation, a pressing issue of which many just aren't aware. I chose to create this image to make it look as if it was written with water.  Not only was this medium novel and unexpected, which I hoped would capture the reader's attention, but it also provided an outlet for me to bridge the words with a visual representation.</p>

			<p>The word "BASIC" is intentially prominent in the image, not only because it is in all upercase letters, but also because it has a slight blue tint.  The pH scale at the top of the magazine spread demonstrates the progression of acidic to basic, and the word "BASIC" is shown in a blue color that is closer to the basic end of the pH scale.  While making the connection between the color of the word "BASIC" and the shade on the pH scale is certainly a rather wide semantic bridge to gap, because the reader is an adult who is reading a magazine that includes scientific articles such as this one, I felt that the choice was an appropriate for the intended audience.</p>

		<h5>The Message (text)</h5>

		<p>I wrote the text component of the magazine spread, which you can read in its entirety <a href="oceanAcidifcation.pdf">here</a>.</p>

		<p>The audience for this magazine spread is adults, particularly millennial adults, who are generally more likely to be concerned with environmental issues and to (potentially) change their habits to help mitigate the problem.  Because the target demographic comprises adults, an informational article is an appropriate for this audience.  The text's message? That ocean acidification is a pressing problem that severely affects ocean wildlife and manmade industries that rely on it—but also that there are steps that can be taken to fix the problem.</p>
		
		<p>The headers and titles in the spread are done in the Helvetica Neue typeface, a decidedly modern type that reflects the progressive mind and relatively young age (millennial) of the reader.  The body text of the article is styled in Calluna, a serif font that is easy to read in print (the intended medium).</p>

		<p>While the image's unconventional medium captures attention and urges readers to "be a bit more basic," a nod to the severity of the acidification of the seas, the text component—the article—explains what ocean acidification is, its current severity, and its consequences on the environment/industries that rely on a healthy environment.  After the end of the article, there are several solutions that can be implemented to fix the problem, from large-scale undertakings to personal changes to which the reader can contribute on an individual level.  The final text component references articles at which the reader can find more information (you can read them <a href="https://usa.oceana.org/what-ocean-acidification">here</a> and <a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/ocean-acidification/">here</a>).  The citation of reputable sources builds ethos, which is crucial when persuading the reader to see a certain view and to take a certain action regarding a topic that is, for many in the audience for this project, completely new.</p>

		<h5>More notes on composition</h5>
		
		<p>Many of the shapes included in the spread are a light blue shade, close to the color of the tint of the word "BASIC" in the graphic.  I chose to do this to create a motif with the color, making it an integral component of the spread and thus emphasizing its importance when used in the image.</p>
		
		<p>The triangle element that extends from the first page to the second is placed specifically to draw the reader's attention from the first page (the tip of the triangle) to the second page, where the triangle's outline crescendoes, keeping the reader's focus.  The reader's eyes then travel to the title of the article, which contains the call to action, where he/she begins to read.  At the right end of the second page of the spread, the resources and links are imposed over a colored column; this visual separation makes it clear to the reader that they are, while part of the spread, not part of the article.</p>

		<h5>Reflection</h5>
		
		<p>In the first column of text, I included <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/images/thumb/e/e3/WOA05_GLODAP_pd_pH_AYool.png/657px-WOA05_GLODAP_pd_pH_AYool.png">this</a> image of the earth with the caption: "Current surface pH of the oceans—the purple regions indicate extreme acidity."  This was done to break up the large blocks of text and provide visual stimulation alongside the written information.  Additionally, the curved outline of the picture balanced the composition of the spread by contrasting with the majority of the lines in the spread, which were straight and vertical or horizontal.</p>
		
		<p>Despite this, I still feel that there needs to be a bit more visual hierarchy, considering the large amount of text included in the spread.  In a redesign of this project, I'd consider employing more editorial help like pull quotes, paragraph delineation, or white space in order to better help the audience to read.</p>
